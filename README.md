# payrollTest
Simple inheritance exercise in Java
In this program we begin with a Person class, which can take existing customers and re-order their name into a phonebook format. This class may be extended to create further classes (customer,agent) which will add their own personalized values should they choose to (address, phone number). A payroll class was also made in case the project was to be extended further, but it was not. A simple test method was also created simply to check if two name values were equal. This was to prepare for potential upcoming data ordering.
